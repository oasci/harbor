# 01-management

This directory will contain primarily text documents related to the management of the project, like correspondence with the university, funding agency, and co-workers, minutes of meetings, and ethical permits.
In addition, we put data management plans and paper notebooks in this folder.

## Organization

This is not an exhaustive set of directories.
More can be added (and documented) with numbers `07` to `99`.

### `01-admin`

Any administrative material from the university or the funding agency shall come here.
For example, one may save public contact information, quotes, and bills, or official letters in this folder.

### `02-grants`

Sometimes, a project should follow the plan written in a grant; saving the accepted grant here is good, so one always has it at hand.

### `03-meetings`

That often becomes a vital folder.
A good practice is to start a minute file before the meeting, which includes the goals and agenda of the meeting.

Alternatively, to one file per meeting, one can have rolling minutes files, where minutes of different meetings (with the same people) follow each other in one file.

### `04-literature`

TODO:

### `05-standards`

The data management plans will (under other tasks) explain how you will organize and name your dataset files, what standards you will use, and where the data will be published.
It is essential to make it available and easy to access to facilitate the plan's implementation during the research process.

### `06-notebook`

Save digital notebook information here.
It could be photos from a paper notebook, self-organized text files, or data exported from an electronic lab notebook (ELN).
